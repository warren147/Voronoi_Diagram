## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Java SE<br>
Download Java SE [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)


## Executing Program

Download the code to your local device. Then, run the ".jar" file to open the GUI. 

## Inspiration

My inspiration for this project stemmed from my passion for computational geometry and my interest in visualizing complex mathematical concepts through interactive applications. This project also ties into my internship at Wing in the summer of 2024 with vectorized databases, as Voronoi diagrams can be used to optimize spatial queries and data partitioning in such databases, enhancing their efficiency and performance.

## Future Development

Utilizing the idea of partitioning the search space with an inverted file index, future development can focus on clustering vectors to optimize search efficiency in a vectorized database.
